MorbidMeter
===========

## Description

MorbidMeter is a perverse Apple Watch app that puts your lifespan into
perspective using various timescales that are easier (or sometimes
harder) to grasp than an actual lifetime.  MorbidMeter can also be
used as a countdown widget to count down to other (not as morbid)
events, such as retirement or graduation.  Time is running out --
MorbidMeter lets you know how quickly!
